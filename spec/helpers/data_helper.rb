Here is what is happening next weekend. You are welcome to camp or just come for the day!<br><\/p> \n<p>We intend to camp at Shannon Creek Campground in either spots 17\/18 or 19\/20. As these are walk in sites, there is some possibility of competition but I am reasonably certain this is where we will be. Itâs right on the lake and has an impossibly gorgeous view. <\/p> \n<p>Our back up plan is to camp at rustic sites (i.e. no water or toilets) along Baker Lake Road, between Park Creek Campground and Shannon Creek Campground around mile marker 33 (please see map). <\/p> \n<p>I am joined by Olivia Lenoue and Ian Hamilton in coordinating this adventure. <\/p> \n<p>Olivia Lenoue (phone #[masked]) is headed up on Thursday at around 10:00 from Mt. Vernon, intending to up at Baker Lake no later than noon. She drives a Turquoise Mazda 3 license plate ADU3208. Please contact her if you are interested in carpooling with her. She intends to stay until Sunday. <\/p> \n<p>Ian Hamilton (phone #[masked]) drives either a Red Ford Ranger (B37799R) or White Suzuki 7D1155. He will be heading up later on Thursday or Friday morning. He intends to stay until Saturday. <\/p> \n<p>Look for their vehicles; they will mark where we are staying. <\/p> \n<p>Due to a work scheduling conflict, I will be headed up early on Saturday but can be contacted by cell until that time if you have any questions. I can be reached at 4255016761. Cell service cuts out about the time you leave HWY 20 so bear that in mind! <\/p> \n<p>Things you need to bring! <\/p> \n<p>Â·&nbsp; 5 dollars a night to chip into paying for the site if we are at Shannon Creek Campground. There is plenty of parking but there might be an additional fee for extra cars (no more than 9 bucks), which is why we are pushing the carpooling idea. <\/p> \n<p>Â·&nbsp; Tent\/shelter and adequate cold weather gear and sleeping equipment. Itâs still chilly up there!<\/p> \n<p>Â·&nbsp; Food (I recommend sâmores)<\/p> \n<p>Â·&nbsp; Swimsuit for the hot springs! <\/p> \n<p>Â·&nbsp; Outdoor gear. We are right on the lake so bring your kayaks and canoes if you got them! There is tons of hiking in this area as well!<\/p> \n<p>HOW TO REACH SHANNON CREEK CAMPGROUND<\/p> \n<p>Take HWY 20 from Cedro-Wooley headed East until you reach Baker Lake Road (on the left). This road continues into the Mt Baker State Park and parellels the west side of the lake. The road will turn from pavement to gravel. Continue straight and stay on the main road until you reach a sign that says Shannon Creek Campground. Turn right here and continue to the end of the campground loop for the spots. <\/p> \n<p>PLEASE CHECK THIS PAGE FOR UPDATES AS WE GET CLOSER!<\/p>\n<p>Map link:<\/p> \n<p>https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/12nwQ6IcLwN5N5yW1fMgyKDEIEdxPZxvTelk1RhEXdB0\/edit?usp=sharing<br><\/p>\n<br>","mtime":1466700049626,"event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Skagit-Social-Club\/events\/231375954\/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":280800000,"payment_required":"0","name":"Overnight, Outdoor Adventure and Hotspring Extravaganza!","id":"231375954","time":1466794800000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","country":"us","city":"Mount Vernon","name":"Skagit Social Club (ages 21 - 40ish)","group_lon":-122.32,"id":19132915,"state":"WA","urlname":"Skagit-Social-Club","category":{"name":"socializing","id":31,"shortname":"socializing"},"group_lat":48.41},"status":"upcoming"}.to_json +
